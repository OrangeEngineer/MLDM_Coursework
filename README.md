# MLDM_Coursework

- These programs were created for Machine Learning and Data mining course by Nuttaphon Tamrapeepithak.
- The program implement the neural network models to make classification on two datasets which are London Crime, Video Games dataset.
- The neural network models are applied perceptron model and multi-layer neural network imported from _Sci-kit learn_.

# London Crimes Classification 

- The main program for analysis is **LondonCrime.py** where it requires **Preprocessed_LondonCrime.csv** for training and testing processes.
- The **Preprocessed_LondonCrime.csv** file is generated from **LondonCrimePreprocessing.py**.
- The raw dataset file that applied in **LondonCrimePreprocessing.py** is **MPS_Borough_Level_Crime_Historic.csv**.

# Video Games Classification

- The main program for analysis is **VideoGameTierPredicter.py** where it requires **Preprocessed_VideoGamePreprocessed.csv** for training and testing processes. 
- The **Preprocessed_LondonCrime.csv** file is generated from **VideoGamePreprocessing.py**.
- The raw dataset file that applied in **VideoGamePreprocessing.py** is **VideGames.csv**.
